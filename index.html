<section><h2> 1. Introduction </h2>

  <p>The subject for this paper is <em>scale</em>.
    In particular, we focus on the scalability of names. It has been
    proposed, or perhaps implied, that names may not scale for at
    least two reasons. First, names are a purely syntactic notion
    which lack any inherent semantic quality; and second, achieving
    global consensus of names is prohibitively expensive at large
    scales. This section outlines the thought process that led me from
    these concerns to a multi-faceted exploration of ad-hoc
    distributed software system design. Sections 2 and 3 present the
    various discoveries I made along the way. Section 4 suggests ideas
    for future exploration, and section 5 concludes.</p>

  <h3> 1.1 To name is human </h3>

  <p>Across the spectrum of human activity, names are ubiquitous. We
    compulsively attach names to things in our environment so we may
    begin to understand them. As our understanding of a thing grows,
    the name we give to the thing absorbs new meaning and thus becomes
    more concise. Similarly, many forms of computer programming are
    merely abstraction-naming games, where the goal is to express
    computations with desirable properties like elegance or
    efficiency. Clearly, the syntactic nature of naming is no barrier
    to our ability to discover and assign meaning to things in the
    real world.</p>

  <p>The scalability of global consensus is, however, undeniably poor,
    particularly if we expect consensus to arise in accordance with
    lofty human ideals like fairness and accountability. When only one
    agent has authority to assign names, global consensus in small
    networks emerges almost trivially. As the number of agents with
    such authority increases, so does the amount of communications
    overhead required to achieve consensus. Inversely, communications
    overhead decreases as trust in the controlling agents increases.
    Hence, large name-based networks tend to degenerate in the face of
    politics and economic factors.</p>

  <p>I found this apparent connection to the soft sciences compelling
    and wanted to determine how far the analogy would stretch.
    According to Katouzian&nbsp;[Kat90], philosophy, science, and
    society are indispensable features of human life. To paraphrase,
    philosophy provides direction to scientific and social endeavors,
    society gives purpose to scientific and philosophical pursuits,
    and science informs the methods of the other two aspects. At the
    intersections of these aspects, we have economics, politics, and
    engineering. Economists quantify social activity like resource
    allocation and exchange; politicians prescribe order for such
    activity according to moral, ethical, and legal priorities; and
    engineers design, implement, and analyze the fruits of the
    decision-making process.</p>

  <p>Consider the typical roles of employees at a large software
    company. The executives identify a problem space and a related
    client base, then secure funding to hire scientists to search for
    novel solutions. Once found, the executives bring in engineers to
    tailor the results to specific occurrences of the problem. This
    example covers the six aspects of the triangle. Note that each
    aspect serves a vital role in the success of the company,
    including the client base and funding source.</p>

  <p>As scientists and engineers, we need to do extra work to
    understand the other four perspectives, which is unfortunate
    because this understanding can bring valuable intuition to bear
    when designing multi-agent systems. This claim is not
    extraordinary. Case in point, the <em>dining philosophers
    problem</em>&nbsp;[Hoa85], as told by Hoare, involves a
    philanthropist (programmer) who hires a College of philosophers
    (processes) that eat (access shared resources) unpredictably. To
    prevent deadlock, the philanthropist appoints a footman
    (semaphore) or a group of lackeys (mutexes). Hoare explains
    livelock as a footman's irrational dislike of certain
    philosophers, and provides precisely-defined laws (system design)
    that govern overall behavior.</p>

  <p>We can also apply basic knowledge of political structures to get
    a grasp on our issues with scalable naming. For instance, a system
    with only one authoritative name-assigning agent is like a
    dictatorship&mdash;changes may be implemented swiftly, but each
    subject agent must remain in sync with the dictator or risk losing
    access to basic services. If the dictator is a tyrant, subjects
    will flee. If demand for basic services overwhelms supply,
    subjects will starve. To avoid these problems, the dictator must
    be responsive to local demand and be willing to delegate
    internally. If the subjects of one dictator wish to interact with
    subjects of another, both dictators must also be capable of
    negotiation.</p>

  <p>If the analogy is sound, then we should be able to construct
    arbitrarily scalable naming systems by establishing regions in
    which distinct dictators enforce <em>local</em> consensus of names
    and then <em>negotiate</em> inter-region translation conventions.
    Note that if subjects are capable of operating under several
    dictators, i.e., holding dual citizenship, then these local
    regions may overlap. Many interesting parallels exist between
    distributed systems and political structures&mdash;for example,
    Paxos&nbsp;[Lam01] resembles the American congress.</p>

  <h4> First idea: decentralized name negotiation </h4>

  <p>My original plan was to explore the conjectured scalable naming
    system directly. I decided to simulate a billion-agent network of
    semi-autonomous regions of authority. To stimulate region
    formation and evolution, I wanted to simulate irrational
    ideological bias&nbsp;[Fin81] regulated by a quantifiable trust
    metric&nbsp;[Gol09], likely modeled as probabilities. After some
    preliminary calculations and a poor reception,
    I shelved the idea in favor of higher-level
    pursuits better suited to my interests.</p>

  <h4> Second idea: scale-free networks </h4>

  <p>While reviewing the literature on massive simulations, I
    discovered that many large, naturally-occurring networks exhibit
    fractal-like qualities. Popular examples include protein
    interaction networks and social networks, which are said to be
    <em>scale free</em>&nbsp[Bar03]. Scale-free networks can be
    characterized by three properties: preferential attachment, small
    network diameter, and resilience to random failure. Preferential
    attachment is a tendency for older nodes to become better
    connected than newer ones. For instance, proteins that evolved
    earlier tend to interact positively with other proteins more
    frequently than newer ones because of sustained evolutionary
    pressure. Similarly, well-connected members of a social network
    get more visibility than new members and so are more likely to
    make new connections. Finally, hubs emerge naturally in the
    presence of preferential attachment. Hubs are rare but
    well-connected, so the diameter of the network remains low and the
    probability that a hub dies randomly is very small for large
    networks. Preferential attachment also leads naturally to multiple
    paths between nodes, which further enhances resilience to random
    failure.</p>

  <p>Many scale-free network services, such as Twitter, Facebook, and
    GMail, expose a traditional star network interface. The Twitter
    retweet network, for example, is a scale-free network&nbsp;[Tin12]
    simulated within Twitter's internal network and exposed through
    the Web. Why does a less efficient model prevail over a direct
    scale-free implementation? What prevents widespread adoption of
    truly scale-free networks? The Twitter core is essentially a
    public message routing service&mdash;an extremely basic
    non-trivial network&mdash;so I tried to build a decentralized
    Twitter-like service to try to answer these question. I discovered
    that designing and debugging ad-hoc distributed systems is highly
    non-trivial and requires specialized tools and methods.</p>

  <h4> Complexity is a <em>design</em> problem </h4>

  <p>Reasoning about concurrent programs is, of course, harder than
     reasoning about sequential programs, even when the concurrent
     program is composed of sequentially-programmed agents. At first,
     the code rapidly became littered with communications
     boilerplate&mdash;managing connections and transmitting
     messages&mdash;which complicated exploration of higher-level
     issues like message routing and management of inter-agent
     relationships. I needed an abstraction to manage communications
     and message delivery so that I could focus on the system design.</p>

  <p>The Actor model seemed like a possible fit for my needs, so I
    tried writing my agents in Erlang. Erlang offers primitive support
    for fast, asynchronous communication, but its distribution model
    is not suited for ad-hoc distribution. In Erlang, the behavior of
    a spawned process is set by the process that initiates the spawn.
    In other words, all nodes participating in a native Erlang cluster
    trust each other implicitly. This arrangement is exactly backwards
    from what I want. Imagine if a Web server merely listened for
    connections on TCP port 80 and then executed whatever data came in
    like a native binary. This clearly won't do. I was able to code a
    proper abstraction to pass tuples over TCP connections, but I had
    to manage a character buffer and the resulting code looked more
    like C than Erlang. In the end, I chose Racket, which also offers
    a complete suite of message management tools based on the standard
    Scheme <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and
    <code>eval</code> operations. Lesson learned: concurrent message
    passing is not exactly the same as distributed message
    passing.</p>

    <pre><code>client (Msg) ->
    {ok, Sock} = gen_tcp:connect("localhost", 4545, [binary, {packet, 0}]),
    ok = gen_tcp:send(Sock, term_to_binary(Msg)),
    ok = gen_tcp:close(Sock).

server() ->
    {ok, LSock} = gen_tcp:listen(4545, [binary, {packet, 0}, {active, false}]),
    {ok, Sock} = gen_tcp:accept(LSock),
    {ok, Bin} = do_recv(Sock, []),
    ok = gen_tcp:close(Sock),
    io:format("~p~n", [binary_to_term(Bin)]).

do_recv(Sock, Bs) ->
    case gen_tcp:recv(Sock, 0) of
        {ok, B} ->
            do_recv(Sock, [Bs, B]);
        {error, closed} ->
            {ok, list_to_binary(Bs)}
    end.</code></pre>

  <h4> Complexity is a <em>construction</em> problem </h4>

  <p>Though communication overhead is annoying, we can usually
    mitigate its negative effects on code clarity with whitespace and
    encapsulation. The bigger problem is in determining if the system
    will operate correctly. Formal methods exist for verifying the
    correctness of a concurrent system design, but we can not verify a
    design until it has been specified. Hence, we often wish to
    explore the possibilities as we formulate a design. Dynamic
    visualization is a powerful tool for gauging the correctness of a
    design in progress.</p>

  <p>Some visualization tools exist, but none were very good for
    evaluating dynamic system designs. Gephi, for example, is geared
    for analyzing properties of very large graph structures like
    degree distribution. yEd, another popular tool,is well-suited for
    smaller structures but provides only static visualizations. To get
    fast, real-time, dynamic visualization, I ended up writing my own
    visualization tool, using a combination of JavaScript
    technologies.</p>

</section>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<section><h2> 2. DiTMon: dynamic visualization </h2>

  <p>The visualization tool consists of three components: front,
    middle and back. The front end is an HTML page that loads the
    D3.js and Socket.io libraries; it manages a set of nodes and a set
    of links. The middle component is a Node.js Web server that
    translates HTTP GET URIs into Socket.io events and dispatches them
    to the front end. The back end is a Racket library that translates
    procedure calls into HTTP GET URIs. The Racket library also
    includes configurable post-event delays to enhance the visibility
    of select events. All three components are included in the
    submission archive. To use the visualization library, first embed
    some visualization calls in the target implementation, then start
    the Node.js Web server and point a browser at it. As the target
    executes, its calls into the library are drawn in real time.</p>

  <p>Each node on the visualization surface corresponds to an agent
    process. A directed edge between two nodes represents an
    established publish-subscribe relationship between two agents.</p>

  <p>A thick colored arrow denotes an inter-agent message exchange. I
    currently support three kinds of messages. A <em>publish</em> message
    is green, an <em>unsubscribe</em> message is yellow, and any other
    message is gray with a dotted tail.</p>

  <p>The limit on nodes per experiment maxed out around 150 because of
    high latency, likely due to browser-based rendering of SVG and the
    relatively high communications overhead of driving the
    visualization through HTTP and WebSockets. I tried to replace the
    HTTP server with direct Unix socket communications, but this
    quickly degenerated into a distracting game of explicit buffer
    management that resembled the earlier problem with Erlang.
    Finally, though Javascript is asynchronous, it is not truly
    multi-threaded.</p>

</section>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<section><h2> 3. Experiments </h2>

  <p>I ended with nine complete experiments, but did not achieve a
    truly scale-free design. Each experiment proceed as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Start publisher(s).</li>
    <li>Start subscribers.</li>
    <li>Subscribe all subscribers to the publisher(s).</li>
    <li>Publish a message.</li>
    <li>Unsubscribe some subscribers.</li>
    <li>Publish another message.</li>
    <li>shutdown publisher(s).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Each agent contains a message inbox, a set of publishers, and a set
    of subscribers.</p>

  <h3> 3.1. Case study: star networks </h3>

  <p>The star network is the classic client-server architecture. When
    the publisher shuts down, it first unsubscribes any existing
    subscribers.</p>

  <h4> 3.1.1. Sequential </h4>

  <svg id="starSync" width="100%" height="7in"></svg><br>
  <button id="starSyncBtn" onclick="ditmonplay ('starSync')">Play</button>

  <h4> 3.1.2. Concurrent </h4>

  <p>An interesting discovery was that Racket uses green threads,
    which causes the apparent layering effect in this version.</p>

  <svg id="starAsync" width="100%" height="7in"></svg><br>
  <button id="starAsyncBtn" onclick="ditmonplay ('starAsync')">Play</button>

  <h5> Multi-star </h5>

  <p>This experiment demonstrates a three-publisher network. For
    visual clarity, no publisher in this example subscribes to
    another, although a realistic deployment would likely include such
    dual-role agents.</p>

  <svg id="starMulti" width="100%" height="7in"></svg><br>
  <button id="starMultiBtn" onclick="ditmonplay ('starMulti')">Play</button>

  <h3> 3.2. Case study: tree networks </h3>

  <p>To promote tree-like growth, each agent contains at most 3 direct
    subscribers. Further subscription requests are deferred to one of
    the existing subscribers for relay, which gives an appearance of
    agents "walking" along the deferral path. When a node
    unsubscribes, it must notify all direct children so that they can
    request another publisher relay. To expedite the shutdown process,
    I send an <em>abort</em> message instead of a full unsubscribe.</p>

  <h4> 3.2.1. Sequential </h4>

  <svg id="treeSync" width="100%" height="7in"></svg><br>
  <button id="treeSyncBtn" onclick="ditmonplay ('treeSync')">Play</button>

  <h4> 3.2.2. Concurrent </h4>

  <svg id="treeAsync" width="100%" height="7in"></svg><br>
  <button id="treeAsyncBtn" onclick="ditmonplay ('treeAsync')">Play</button>

  <h5> Multi-tree </h5>

  <svg id="treeMulti" width="100%" height="7in"></svg><br>
  <button id="treeMultiBtn" onclick="ditmonplay ('treeMulti')">Play</button>

  <h3> 3.3. Case study: wheel networks </h3>

  <p>The wheel network adds redundancy to the star network by making
    each subscriber a relay for the next. For large networks, this
    gives the appearance of a spider stitching together its web.</p>

  <h4> 3.3.1. Sequential </h4>

  <svg id="wheelSync" width="100%" height="7in"></svg><br>
  <button id="wheelSyncBtn" onclick="ditmonplay ('wheelSync')">Play</button>

  <h4> 3.3.2. Asynchronous </h4>

  <p>It turns out that maintaining consistent references to the "next"
    and "previous" subscriber is not straight-forward in a concurrent
    setting, so I ended up guarding subscribe/unsubscribe events in
    the publisher's thread with a semaphore.</p>

  <svg id="wheelAsync" width="100%" height="7in"></svg><br>
  <button id="wheelAsyncBtn" onclick="ditmonplay ('wheelAsync')">Play</button>

</section>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<section><h2> 4. Future work </h2>

  <p>Now that I understand better the implications of Racket's green
    threads, I would like to port the experiments to a platform with
    better concurrency model, such as Erlang. This will also give me
    an opportunity to gain performance by figuring out proper buffer
    management. Also, I suspect there are more tools and literature on
    the subject of dynamic visualization. Finding these resources
    would accelerate the development process. </p>

  <p>I would also like to continue pursuing a scale-free model. Now
    that I have supporting tools in place, the hard part is figuring
    out how to simulate preferential attachment. A direct approach is
    to choose the set of publisher relays for each subscriber agent
    probabilisticly, where the probability that a given node becomes a
    publisher relay is proportional to some function of the number of
    existing subscriber nodes. Evaluating failures will also require
    more thought, though a probabilistic approach seems fairly
    direct.</p>

</section>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<section><h2> 5. Conclusion </h2>

  <p>Throughout this work, I've made the assumption that ad-hoc
    distributed systems are interesting and important. With that in
    mind, I discovered that designing ad-hoc distributed systems is
    difficult, and so is constructing them without a formal model.
    Furthermore, visualization is not trivial&mdash;I ended up
    spending more time on it than I had planned for and never got
    around to designing a truly scale-free network. I did, however,
    acquire a deeper understanding of some of the difficulties.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, I learned that there is value in
    general-purpose tools to assist in the design and construction of
    ad-hoc overlay networks. Though related tools and services exist,
    trying to fit them to this task can be difficult and
    distracting.</p>
